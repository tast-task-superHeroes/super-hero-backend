# super-hero-backend

## start 
#### git clone https://github.com/tast-task-superHeroes/super-hero-backend.git
#### npm install
#### npm start


## if you want update database with 19 super heroes
#### npm run sync

### Description
#### The database is deployed on neon.tech.
#### The server part works on render.com
##### If you open the site for the first time, you need to wait a few minutes for the database to load because I am using the free version of the service.

##### On the backend part, I created several endpoints by which you can get all heroes, get only one hero, delete a hero, create a hero and update a hero.
##### base url = https://superhero-bc13.onrender.com
##### get all endpoint = /heroes - method GET
##### get one hero = /heroes/heroId - method GET
##### delete hero = /heroes/heroId - method DELETE
##### create hero = /heroes = method POST
##### update hero = /heroes/heroId = method PATCH
